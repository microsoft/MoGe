MoGe is a powerful model for recovering 3D geometry from monocular open-domain images. The model consists of a ViT encoder and a convolutional decoder. It directly predicts an affine-invariant point map as well as a mask that excludes regions with undefined geometry (e.g., sky), from which the camera shift, camera focal length and depth map can be further derived.

## Features

* **Accurate 3D geometry estimation**: Estimate point maps from single images with high precision. Capable of capturing depth variations up to 1000Ã—, ensuring a comprehensive scene representation.
* **Optional ground-truth FOV input**: Enhance model accuracy further by providing the true field of view.
* **Flexible resolution support**: Works seamlessly with various resolutions and aspect ratios, from 2:1 to 1:2.
* **Optimized for speed**: Achieves <0.1s latency per image on an A100 / RTX 3090 GPU with fp16, and 0.2s with fp32.

## TODO List

  - **Training and evaluation code released!**
  - Installation via pip and CLI usage supported. 

## Installation

### Install via pip
  
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/MoGe.git
```

### Or clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MoGe.git
cd MoGe
```

and install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MoGe should be compatible with most requirements versions. Please check the `requirements.txt` for more details if you have concerns.

## Usage

### Pretrained model

The ViT-Large model has been uploaded to Hugging Face hub at [Ruicheng/moge-vitl](https://huggingface.co/Ruicheng/moge-vitl). 
You may load the model via `MoGeModel.from_pretrained("Ruicheng/moge-vitl")` without manually downloading.

If loading the model from a local file is preferred, you may manually download the model from the huggingface hub and load it via `MoGeModel.from_pretrained("PATH_TO_LOCAL_MODEL.pt")`.

### Minimal code example 

Here is a minimal example for loading the model and inferring on a single image. 

```python
import cv2
import torch
from moge.model.v1 import MoGeModel

device = torch.device("cuda")

# Load the model from huggingface hub (or load from local).
model = MoGeModel.from_pretrained("Ruicheng/moge-vitl").to(device)                             

# Read the input image and convert to tensor (3, H, W) and normalize to [0, 1]
input_image = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread("PATH_TO_IMAGE.jpg"), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)                       
input_image = torch.tensor(input_image / 255, dtype=torch.float32, device=device).permute(2, 0, 1)    

# Infer 
output = model.infer(input_image)
# `output` has keys "points", "depth", "mask" and "intrinsics",
# The maps are in the same size as the input image. 
# {
#     "points": (H, W, 3),    # scale-invariant point map in OpenCV camera coordinate system (x right, y down, z forward)
#     "depth": (H, W),        # scale-invariant depth map
#     "mask": (H, W),         # a binary mask for valid pixels. 
#     "intrinsics": (3, 3),   # normalized camera intrinsics
# }
# For more usage details, see the `MoGeModel.infer` docstring.
```

### Gradio demo | `moge app`

The demo is also available at our [Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ruicheng/MoGe).

```bash
# Using the command line tool
moge app

# In this repo
python moge/scripts/app.py   # --share for Gradio public sharing
```

See also [`moge/scripts/app.py`](moge/scripts/app.py) 


### Inference | `moge infer`

Run the script `moge/scripts/infer.py` via the following command:

```bash
# Save the output [maps], [glb] and [ply] files
moge infer -i IMAGES_FOLDER_OR_IMAGE_PATH --o OUTPUT_FOLDER --maps --glb --ply

# Show the result in a window (requires pyglet < 2.0, e.g. pip install pyglet==1.5.29)
moge infer -i IMAGES_FOLDER_OR_IMAGE_PATH --o OUTPUT_FOLDER --show
```

For detailed options, run `moge infer --help`:

```
Usage: moge infer [OPTIONS]

  Inference script for the MoGe model.

Options:
  -i, --input PATH            Input image or folder path. "jpg" and "png" are
                              supported.
  --fov_x FLOAT               If camera parameters are known, set the
                              horizontal field of view in degrees. Otherwise,
                              MoGe will estimate it.
  -o, --output PATH           Output folder path
  --pretrained TEXT           Pretrained model name or path. Defaults to
                              "Ruicheng/moge-vitl"
  --device TEXT               Device name (e.g. "cuda", "cuda:0", "cpu").
                              Defaults to "cuda"
  --fp16                      Use fp16 precision for 2x faster inference.
  --resize INTEGER            Resize the image(s) & output maps to a specific
                              size. Defaults to None (no resizing).
  --resolution_level INTEGER  An integer [0-9] for the resolution level for
                              inference. Higher value means more tokens and
                              the finer details will be captured, but
                              inference can be slower. Defaults to 9. Note
                              that it is irrelevant to the output size, which
                              is always the same as the input size.
                              `resolution_level` actually controls
                              `num_tokens`. See `num_tokens` for more details.
  --num_tokens INTEGER        number of tokens used for inference. A integer
                              in the (suggested) range of `[1200, 2500]`.
                              `resolution_level` will be ignored if
                              `num_tokens` is provided. Default: None
  --threshold FLOAT           Threshold for removing edges. Defaults to 0.03.
                              Smaller value removes more edges. "inf" means no
                              thresholding.
  --maps                      Whether to save the output maps and fov(image,
                              depth, mask, points, fov).
  --glb                       Whether to save the output as a.glb file. The
                              color will be saved as a texture.
  --ply                       Whether to save the output as a.ply file. The
                              color will be saved as vertex colors.
  --show                      Whether show the output in a window. Note that
                              this requires pyglet<2 installed as required by
                              trimesh.
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

### 360Â° panorama images | `moge infer_panorama` 

> *NOTE: This is an experimental extension of MoGe.*

The script will split the 360-degree panorama image into multiple perspective views and infer on each view separately. 
The output maps will be combined to produce a panorama depth map and point map. 

Note that the panorama image must have spherical parameterization (e.g., environment maps or equirectangular images). Other formats must be converted to spherical format before using this script. Run `moge infer_panorama --help` for detailed options.
